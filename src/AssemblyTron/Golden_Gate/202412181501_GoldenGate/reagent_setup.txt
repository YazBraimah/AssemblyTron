Place the coldtuberack in slot 1. 
Put 300uL tips in slot 6 & 9, and 10uL tips in slot 5. 
Instructions for setting up the coldtuberack: 
Put mas00001_(LHA)_forward in A1
Add an empty tube to A1 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put mas00002_(LHA)_reverse in A2
Add an empty tube to A2 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put mas00003_(SFGFP)_forward in A3
Add an empty tube to A3 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put mas00004_(SFGFP)_reverse in A4
Add an empty tube to A4 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put mas00005_(e3P3eGFP)_forward in A5
Add an empty tube to A5 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put mas00006_(e3P3eGFP)_reverse in A6
Add an empty tube to A6 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put mas00007_(RHA)_forward in B1
Add an empty tube to B1 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put mas00008_(RHA)_reverse in B2
Add an empty tube to B2 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Add these templates directly to 24 tuberack in deckslot 2: 
Put pGGAselect in B3
NOTE: if a template is listed twice, (ie, pwl106 in B6 and C3) then skip the second position, and move remaining templates up a slot 
This is ok because this setup sheet and df object in the script are both set up from pcr.csv, except df just takes out repeasts.  
These go in the cold tuberack again.  
Put CG6055 in B4
Add an empty tube to B4on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put DGRC_1298_-_JN22 in B5
Add an empty tube to B5on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put pM37_kG4 in B6
Add an empty tube to B6on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Place empty tube in C4 for the T4/BSA mix 
Place T4 ligase in C5 
Place DMSO in D6 of tuberack2 (since it needs to be at room temp) 
Place 100X BSA in C6 
Place paqCI activator in D1 of cold tuberack (if needed) 
Place T4 buffer in D2 
Place DPNI in D3
