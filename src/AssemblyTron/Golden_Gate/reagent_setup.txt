Put mas00001_(CG6225_lha)_forward in A1
Put mas00002_(CG6225_lha)_reverse in A2
Put mas00003_(kG4)_forward in A3
Put mas00004_(kG4)_reverse in A4
Put mas00005_(CG6225_rha)_forward in A5
Put mas00006_(CG6225_rha)_reverse in A6
Put mas00007_(pBH_2)_forward in B1
Put mas00008_(pBH_2)_reverse in B2
NOTE: if a template is listed twice, (ie, pwl106 in B6 and C3) then skip the second position, and move remaining templates up a slot 
This is ok because this setup sheet and df object in the script are both set up from pcr.csv, except df just takes out repeasts.  
Put CG6225_LHA in B3
Put pM37_kG4 in B4
Put CG6225_RHA in B5
Put pBH_0 in B6
